## It is always wonderful to stop amidst a strict routine to appreciate the beauty around us

It's yet another day of routine for Myk, a project lead in a leading company. It's raining cats and dogs for the past four hours. Myk has a lovely view from the porch of his 3BHK apartment, taking a sip of his strong hot coffee while he adores the blend of cold breeze hitting his bare arms and smell of mud ripping through his nose. He is certainly excited today as he is so close to his promotion. He has been working so hard for months. It's all going to happen after the presentation he is about to give tomorrow. Months of hard work, utmost support from his wife. Everything is finally going to pay off. He wonders how happy his wife will be if he makes her favorite pancake with pineapple sauce. He had all the time in the world to enjoy the rain, think about his lovely wife and cuddle with his 10month old daughter. He starts to check if he has everything to surprise his wife. With almost no noise, Myk made the pancakes and sauce, served it in a platter in shape of a heart. He knows his wife will always appreciate some gentle expression of love. Who doesn't? But you can only get a man not thinking about work for so long. He thinks he'll have a final look at the presentation. He picks up the baby room monitor, goes to his desk, opens his presentation in his laptop. It was calm. In fact, it was very calm which can make any soul uncomfortable. Suddenly, the cry of the baby screeched through the baby monitor. Emily was awake. Even before he could stand from his desk, he hears the voice of wife consoling Emily. The soft, calming voice of his wife relaxed him so much and he starts to adore the voice. The voice continued into a song, a sleeping song for Emily which stopped the cry. He could see the baby's room from his desk. Hearing his wife's lovely voice sing and watching the door, he did not feel the existence of walls and as if he is in the room with them. Suddenly, there was another sound. The sound of someone's footsteps on the front door. The rain had just stopped. He walks towards the front door to open it. On the way to it, he sees the door open from the outside slowly. Something out of ordinary, his heart pounded harder. The silhouette of that person became slowly clearer as he approached the door. He is completely agitated. It is his wife, Rebecca, standing right there
in front of him. "Hi Honey!, How's Emily? is she still sleeping?" asks Rebecca.
