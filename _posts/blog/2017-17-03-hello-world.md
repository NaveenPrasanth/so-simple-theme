It's hard you know?
## Building up the discipline to do what I want
Why is it so hard to consistently do anything that I know will help, teach, improve me in the long run? Never have I ever sighed at the thought of browsing Reddit for hours with a smirk on my face. Never have I ever had a second thought before clicking on play_dota2, even though I had felt like killing the entire humanity after some games. But why is it so hard to do something everyday at the same time at least a little? Like writing a personal diary. I could add a ton more things to that list. For instance,
1. Watching a video from my favorite course
2. Documenting what I did at work today
3. Learn a new word
4. Talk with favorite person
... and more important activities like brushing, bathing.(just kidding){am I?}

Whenever I build up the courage to do the things I want. A strange feeling breezes through me. It subtly asks "why bother?". I start to contemplate. Not so late, my mind thinks, "One day I will be forgotten, what is the point? why try so hard to be disciplined?". I know I may sound like a nihilist, pessimist, a person with existential crisis. But I seriously believe I am not one of those people, at least not now. I see good in life, content with what I have, have enough curiosity in things to drive me, always try to help peers in need. Is it because I always did what I did without leaving my comfort zone and I take everything around me for granted? Didn't I ever try harder, work harder? I remember I did, back when I was in school surrounded by other humans(friends) all the time. Never had the necessity to think, act, face difficulties alone.
Learned, experimented, implemented everything as community. May be that why I'm struggling to find discipline now? Did I answer my own question? Why am I asking so many questions? I simply do not know.

If someone was able to reach till here. Wow, You've got great patience. Don't waste your time reading this shitty post. There are oceans of content out there waiting to be consumed by you. Writing this article was yet another desperate attempt of mine to follow my passion of writing. May the discipline come to me or me to it.

## Subjective answer to existential crisis
You'll probably be saying, "What is wrong with this guy?".
Trust me. I don't know. I believe that the earth, life and thought are accidents. Humanity has had different priorities at different point in time.
It is important to empathize with people while reading history and be skeptical about it. Nobody knows why we exist. People usually give their own reason to exist and try to accomplish it. Its like playing GTA minus the missions plus self tailored new missions. Spawned in a Hierarchical society, we set goals and progress towards it, till death. The only difference is, there is no respawn. Make peace with this. Death is certain. Do the dance in between. Make sure the dance has no breaks.

If you think this guy sucks at writing and hope I die. That will happen, just not today.

PS: don't judge me
